# mau 

I use [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) for my command line purposes in [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) on the Mac.  **mau** is a
Oh My Zsh theme that I hacked together combining the best of the _kphoen_ and _smt_ themes.  **mau** is the English literation
of the Chinese word for _cat_.  This theme puts all the status information on one line then has a clean command line with a single prompt character - simplified Chinese character for _cat_ - and status info on the far right of the line.
